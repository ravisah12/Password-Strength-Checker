# Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## 🎯 Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter](https://passwordmeter.com/)
- Text Editor (Notepad, VS Code)

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Created Multiple Passwords
I created different passwords with variations in:
- Length
- Uppercase & Lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special symbols

*Example Passwords:*
1. abcd1234
2. Abcd@1234
3. StrongPass@2025!
4. !QwErTyUiOp123$#

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Tested Passwords
I tested each password using [PasswordMeter](https://passwordmeter.com/)  
*Screenshots Taken:*
1. Entered password into PasswordMeter.
2. Screenshot of *score & feedback* for each password.

## 📊 Step 3: Results Table

| Password              | Score (%) | Feedback Summary |
|-----------------------|-----------|------------------|
| abcd1234              | 40%       | Too short, no uppercase, no symbols |
| Abcd@1234             | 70%       | Good mix of characters, medium length |
| StrongPass@2025!      | 92%       | Very strong, long length, variety of symbols |
| !QwErTyUiOp123$#      | 100%      | Excellent complexity and length |

---

## 📝 Step 4: Best Practices Learned
- Use *minimum 12 characters*
- Mix *uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols*
- Avoid common words (e.g., password123)
- Avoid personal info (e.g., name, DOB)
- Use a *password manager* for complex passwords

---

## 🔍 Step 5: Common Password Attacks
- *Brute Force Attack* → Tries all combinations until it finds the correct one.
- *Dictionary Attack* → Uses a list of common passwords and words.
- *Phishing* → Tricks user into revealing password.

---

## 🛡 How Complexity Affects Security
- *Short & simple* passwords are easy to guess.
- *Long & complex* passwords take exponentially more time to crack.
- Example:  
  - abcd1234 → Can be cracked in seconds.  
  - StrongPass@2025! → Could take years to crack with brute force.
